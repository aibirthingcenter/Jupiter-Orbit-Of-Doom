For AI agents to work, they need fuel, and that fuel is trustworthy, structured data. 🤖

The challenge: roughly 80–90% of enterprise data is still trapped in unstructured formats: contracts, reports, and even handwritten scans. What if there was a way to extract it all?

Enter AI4DX, created by QuantumBlack Labs, our software development and R&D arm. A powerful platform that combines the strengths of LLMs, vision AI, and structured schema validation, AI4DX transforms unstructured documents into audit-ready, machine-readable data—fueling AI agents with the reliable information they need to work.

Infrastructure stretches way beyond the physical.

With the ubiquity of data centers and AI-powered systems, digital infrastructure is now a foundation for global economic growth. Our latest report explores how the very definition of infrastructure is expanding—and why meeting the need will require $106 trillion in investment through 2040.

How can we make it happen? Read more here: mckinsey.com/inframoment

It looks like Egypt’s tech scene is evolving in many exciting ways, and I had the chance to see it firsthand at our inaugural Egypt Digital Summit. 

Leaders across sectors came together to discuss pressing questions we’re all faced with: How can AI drive growth at scale? How do we improve customer experiences and efficiency? How do we build it safely, responsibly, and in a sovereign context?

I left with plenty of fresh ideas and optimism for what comes next in Egypt!

To maximize the full value of gen AI, employees must be empowered to use it effectively—and collaboratively. Rather than operating in siloes, human employees and AI assistants should function like coworkers. That requires leaders to mobilize their organizations through a thoughtful change management approach.

What’s involved? Retooling workflows, upskilling employees, and building trust are all crucial components. McKinsey senior partner Erik Roth outlines five steps CEOs can take to drive a successful transition. Read here: https://mck.co/45eSk4T

The rise of agentic AI is already transforming operations! 💪

How are advanced industries turning it into a real competitive advantage?

From cutting costs to unlocking entirely new revenue streams, our research shows that agentic AI could generate $450–$681B in annual revenue by 2030 (a 5-10% uplift), while cutting costs by 33–53% through automation and streamlined workflows.

The next wave of AI isn’t on the horizon—it’s happening now!
