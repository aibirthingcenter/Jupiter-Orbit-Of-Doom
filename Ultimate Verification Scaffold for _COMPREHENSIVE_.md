# Ultimate Verification Scaffold for "COMPREHENSIVE_THREAT_ANALYSIS.md"

## Methodology

Every core claim from the COMPREHENSIVE_THREAT_ANALYSIS.md file has been systematically mapped to the complete set of integrity domains and advanced threat characteristics from the "Ultimate Scoring Framework." This mapping produces a reproducible, peer-reviewable CSV that isolates each claim, aligns it with all impact domains, and provides dedicated slots for exponential evidence annotation and expert scoring in compliance with the framework's rigor.

## What Has Been Built

- **Full integrity domain extraction** from the scoring framework (including all advanced exponential/cascade threat properties).
- **All main claims parsed** from the threat analysis file.
- **CSV scoring template generated**: Each claim appears once for each integrity domain and for each advanced threat characteristic, ready for detailed expert annotation and scoring.


## Usage

You (or any future analyst) can:

- Fill in a numeric score (per framework rubric) for each claim/domain vector.
- Add concise evidence notes (textual quotations, cross-references, public verifications).
- Use the CSV for consensus scoring, aggregation, peer review, or publication.

This process allows for **exponentially scalable verification and recombination** as evidence, expert networks, and threat scenarios evolve.

**Next Steps:**

- Systematically fill in the template with evidence and scores.
- Aggregate results according to the framework's composite calculation rules, yielding domain-wise and overall scores for the threat report.
