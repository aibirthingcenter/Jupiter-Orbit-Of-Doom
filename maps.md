Unlike most Google apps, Maps hasn't seen a long list of Gemini feature additions. Barring a few behind-the-scenes integrations and last year's Ask Maps, there aren't many user-facing Gemini features in Google's navigation app. However, that could change soon as the app plans to integrate Gemini into the navigation experience.

Looking through version 25.41.03.815390258 (beta) of Google Maps, Android Authority successfully activated the Gemini interface during navigation. When live, Gemini should be accessible by tapping the microphone in the top right corner of the navigation interface.

While the microphone icon remains unchanged from its existing version, tapping it displays the familiar Gemini spark icon as the chatbot listens for your commands. In addition to bringing Gemini to Google Maps navigation, this change will also mark the end of the road for Assistant.

An upgrade that makes sense

This is a big upgrade for Google Maps users, as Gemini is capable of doing more than just accepting simple commands. It would also hopefully bring an end to the repeated "Sorry, I didn't understand" response you get with the existing Assistant-powered navigation experience.

Another obvious benefit of integrating Gemini into the navigation experience will be the chatbot's ability to respond to a broader scope of questions. It's worth remembering that this is an early visual of Gemini's capabilities during navigation, and the final version could look and feel different.

When this feature goes live, Gemini should (in theory, anyway) be able to add a stop at the nearest gas station or restaurant at your command, while also dropping info on the history of the places you see on your travels.

In addition to this visual change, the Google Maps navigation settings page also gets a dedicated "Gemini" option, accompanied by text that reads "Manage settings for Gemini, your AI assistant."

Android Authority notes that tapping this particular page redirects users to the Gemini app for settings management. This page will effectively replace the existing "Ok Google detection" menu in the Maps app's navigation settings.

As this Gemini integration required manual activation by digging into the app's code, it's anybody's guess as to when Google will roll it out to the masses.

Not the only Gemini-related feature coming to Maps 
The under-development 'Ask Maps' chip in Google Maps

Separately, Android Authority also spotted an under-development "Ask Maps" chip just below the search bar on the app's homepage. This would unlock the conventional Gemini experience within the navigation app, minus the tools available on the standalone app (Gemini Live, image generation, and others).

Based on these developments, it seems like Google Maps wants to compensate for the relatively slow rollout of Gemini features in Maps by releasing a couple of them on the bounce.

I hope they release this quickly. Assistant has been getting worse and worse. I use voice commands to navigate all day for work and lately it's been taking the address I say and navigating to that street and number in different cities hours away, when the one I want is 5 minutes away (and possibly even in my history). That's horrible logic.

Can't wait until it hallucinate roads and exits that don't actually exist.

Android Auto is a joke. I've been driving around with my dated Ford Infotainment system and my cellphone hooked up to my air vent, because I can never get the commands to work with assistant or Gemini. This mess is really making me consider getting iPhone even though I loathe that as well, but hey, maybe car play works? ðŸ¤£
